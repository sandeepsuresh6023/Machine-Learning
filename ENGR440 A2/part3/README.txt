The program is written in python.
The program file for Part 2:Genetic Programming for Classification is classification.py.
The program automatically takes the regression.txt file. It requires the deap machine learning library. Additionally it needs the 'numpy', 'copy', 'operator', 'csv', 'pandas', 'itertools' and 'random' python libraries.
The program takes the 'breast-cancer-wisconsin.data' file as its input and seperates it into training and test sets. The training set is stored in training.txt and the test set in test.txt.
The program outputs the log files of the genetic evolution. The best candidate solution is also printed. In addition to this the program provides the classification accuracy on both the training and test set. The number of generations is set to 100.
